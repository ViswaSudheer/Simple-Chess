This project is a simple two-player Chess game developed using Java. It provides a graphical user interface where players can play a standard game of chess against each other. The game implements all basic chess rules, including valid piece movements, check, checkmate, and stalemate detection. The code follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with separate classes handling the board, pieces, and game logic. The project helps in understanding how classic board games like chess can be built using Java and reinforces core concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and event-driven programming. This project is intended for educational purposes and does not include AI or multiplayer networking features.
